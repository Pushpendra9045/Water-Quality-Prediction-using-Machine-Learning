Project Title: Water Potability Prediction

Description
This project aims to predict the potability of water using a machine learning model. The dataset used for this analysis is "water_potability.csv," obtained from Kaggle. The dataset contains various physicochemical properties of water samples collected from different sources, along with an indicator of whether the water is potable or not.

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can classify water samples as potable or non-potable based on their physicochemical features. The model will be trained using a supervised learning approach and evaluated using appropriate performance metrics.


Dataset
The dataset "water_potability.csv" can be downloaded from the following Kaggle source link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityakadiwal/water-potability?resource=download

The dataset contains the following columns:

pH: pH level of the water
Hardness: Water hardness
Solids: Total dissolved solids (TDS)
Chloramines: Amount of chloramines in the water
Sulfate: Sulfate concentration
Conductivity: Water conductivity
Organic_carbon: Organic carbon content
Trihalomethanes: Trihalomethanes concentration
Turbidity: Water turbidity
Potability: Indicator variable (1 if potable, 0 if non-potable)

Files
water_potability.csv: The dataset file containing the water samples and their corresponding potability labels.
water Quality Prediction.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

Workflow
Data Loading and Exploration

Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
Perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset.
Handle any missing values or data inconsistencies.
Data Preprocessing

Split the data into features (X) and target (y) variables.
Perform any necessary data preprocessing steps, such as scaling or encoding categorical variables.
Model Training and Selection

Select an appropriate machine learning algorithm for classification.
Define the model and hyperparameters to be tuned.
Use a suitable technique (e.g., grid search) to tune the hyperparameters.
Train the model on the training set.

Model Evaluation
